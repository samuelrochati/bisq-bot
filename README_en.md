## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or above
- pnpm package manager

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Configuration

Configure relevant parameters in the `.env` file, such as API Key, Secret, and trading pairs to monitor. Refer to the `env.example` file.

```env
BITGET_API_KEY=Your_Bitget_API_Key
BITGET_SECRET=Your_Bitget_Secret
ASTER_API_KEY=Your_AsterDex_API_Key
ASTER_API_SECRET=Your_AsterDex_API_Secret
# Other configuration items
```

### Start the Bot

#### 1. Start Trend Strategy (trend & recommended trendv2)

The trend strategy is based on SMA30 breakout, automatically determines long/short positions, and dynamically manages stop loss and take profit.

**It is recommended to use the new trendv2 strategy, which is more complete, has stronger risk control, and supports advanced features such as multiple order locks, dynamic stop loss, and trailing take profit.**

```bash
pnpm start
# or
pnpm trendV2
# or
npx tsx trendV2.ts
```

> The old trend.ts is still available, but it is recommended to use trendv2.

#### Main advantages of trendv2:
- Multiple order locks to prevent risk control issues caused by concurrent orders
- Advanced risk control such as stop loss, trailing take profit, and automatic stop loss movement after profit
- Real-time market snapshots and order status tracking, automatically cancels invalid pending orders
- Clearer strategy logic and more detailed log output
- Compatible with the original SMA30 trend breakout logic, easy to migrate

### 2. Start Market Making Strategy (maker)

The market-making strategy automatically places both buy and sell orders on the order book. After a trade is executed, only the closing direction order is placed, with risk control stop loss.

```bash
pnpm maker
# or
npx tsx maker.ts
```

#### 3. Start Dual Exchange Hedging Strategy (bitget/aster)

```bash
pnpm cli:start
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```
